# project-info
A list of all projects and some info about them.

Prriority is measured as follows: 1 is max priority, and then we go onwards for lesser priorites.

## AkulAI (the core program)
| Topic    | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Priority    | 1 |
| Supported OS    | Windows, Linux, MacOS (MacOS not tested) |

## RLVoice
| Topic    | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Priority    | 2 |

## AkulAI-Plugins
| Topic    | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Priority    | 2 |
| Supported OS    | Windows, Linux, MacOS (MacOS not tested) |

The rest are all at least priority as of right now. This doesn't mean that you can't help work on it, however.
